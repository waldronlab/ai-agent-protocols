# Agent Skills

Agent skills that are defined by the protocol standard rather than by any one community, and so
version with it.

*   [`protocol-runner`](protocol-runner/SKILL.md) — discovers protocols across the federation,
    ranks them by trust and status, resolves dependencies, emits a two-level provenance block before
    executing anything, and drafts a Methods section afterwards.

## Why these live here

Everything the runner does — how it ranks by `trust_tier`, what it does with a `draft`,
`superseded`, or `deprecated` protocol, which fields it reads from `PROTOCOLS.yaml`, the shape of
the provenance block — is specified by [`PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md`](../PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md). A runner
that lags the standard silently changes what "executed this protocol" means. Keeping them in one
repository means one pull request changes both. See
[ADR 0007](../docs/adr/0007-host-the-runner-with-the-standard.md).

## Installing

Skills are plain markdown; there is no package to install. Clone this repository and make the skill
directory visible to your agent. For Claude Code, symlink it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/waldronlab/agent-protocol-standard.git
ln -s "$PWD/agent-protocol-standard/skills/protocol-runner" ~/.claude/skills/protocol-runner
```

A symlink rather than a copy, so `git pull` is the whole update process.

## Format

The frontmatter follows [Bioconductor's `SKILL_STANDARD.md`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/ai-agent-skills/blob/devel/SKILL_STANDARD.md)
— `name`, `description`, `version`, `category`, `author`, plus optional `tags` — so a skill from here
drops into a collection that follows that convention without modification. The directory name must
match the frontmatter `name`.
