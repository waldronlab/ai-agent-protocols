# agent-protocol-standard

This repository defines the standard for AI agent-compatible scientific protocols, publishes the tooling that enforces it, and hosts the central federation registry. Protocols themselves live in federated content repositories, registered in [`registry.yaml`](registry.yaml).

*   [`PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md`](PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md) — the specification a `protocol.md` must conform to.
*   [`actions/`](actions/) — composite GitHub Actions that validate protocols and generate a repository's `PROTOCOLS.yaml` index.
*   [`registry.yaml`](registry.yaml) — the federated repositories agents discover protocols from.
*   [`skills/`](skills/) — the `protocol-runner` agent skill, whose behaviour the standard defines.
*   [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — the decisions behind the standard.

This repository hosts no protocols of its own. The Waldron Lab's protocols are in [`waldronlab/agent-protocols`](https://github.com/waldronlab/agent-protocols), an ordinary federation node with no special standing — see [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-separate-standard-from-protocol-content.md).

*This repository was named `waldronlab/ai-agent-protocols` until September 2026. GitHub redirects the old name, but please update pinned references.*

## What is an AI Agent Protocol?

An "AI Agent Protocol" is related to but different than an [AI Skill](https://github.com/bioconductor/ai-agent-skills).

*   **AI Skill**: A specific capability given to an AI agent (e.g., how to query a specific biological database, or how to use a particular R package). Skills teach the AI *how* to perform specific actions.
*   **AI Agent Protocol**: A scientific workflow, experimental plan, or analytical pipeline designed to be executed by or in collaboration with an AI agent. Protocols in this registry are **designed around provenance to published methods**. Protocols:
    - are formal records providing citation both to primary scientific literature and to publication of protocols (#4). Atomic protocols have a single purpose with a single citation to primary literature; composite protocols may be composed of multiple atomic protocols.
    - will record **human reviews** (#2)
    - will support **formal unit tests/benchmarks** (#3) to verify correct execution by different AI agents and models. 

## Utility and Core Use Cases

Some likely use cases include:

1. **Constraining Coding Agents to Established Methods**: Forces AI agents to adhere strictly to vetted, peer-reviewed analytical protocols rather than drifting, inventing parameters, or inventing plausible but untested methodology during automated script generation. Protocols are expected to create more uniform behavior by different AI agents and models.
2. **Cross-Language and Pipeline Translation**: Serves as an unambiguous English-language specification for translating computational workflows across programming languages and pipeline frameworks (e.g., Nextflow ↔ Snakemake, R ↔ Python) without losing domain-specific logic or parameter integrity.
3. **Discrepancy Auditing (Paper vs. Code vs. Protocol)**: Acts as an explicit benchmark to systematically detect inconsistencies between high-level descriptions in published manuscript Methods sections, formal protocol documentation, and actual codebase implementations. Protocols should be easier for people with domain expertise to review than codebase or even Methods sections which are less structured, can be split across main manuscript and supplementary materials, and may lack necessary details for full implementation.
4. **Filling the Methodological Reproducibility Gap**: Provides the granular operational, environment, and parameter-level details that traditional journal Methods sections often omit, facilitating computational reproducibility with less susceptbility to bitrot or dependency issues.
5. **A federated registry of AI agent-compatible protocols**: This repository serves as a central registry for AI agent-compatible protocols, designed to allow researchers to independently create their own protocol repositories and federate them into this central registry. 

## Using this standard in your own protocol repository

Protocol repositories federate into the registry here, and need no copy of the tooling: validation
and index generation are published from this repository as GitHub composite actions, so both stay in
lockstep with [`PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md`](PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md). Pin them to a release tag.

**Copy the contents of [`template/`](template/) into a new empty repository.** It is a complete
content node: the two workflows, a README and CONTRIBUTING that name this standard as the authority
on format, and a conforming starter protocol at `protocols/example-protocol/protocol.md` to rename
and edit. The starter is validated by this repository's own test suite on every pull request, so it
cannot quietly fall behind the standard it demonstrates.

Then:

1. Replace the placeholders in `README.md` and edit `protocols/example-protocol/` into your first
   real protocol — the directory name must match the frontmatter `name`.
2. Add a `LICENSE`. The template deliberately ships none, because the choice is yours; the README
   describes the dual arrangement this project uses (CC-BY-4.0 for protocols, MIT for everything
   else).
3. Push to `main` and let the index generate.

Both actions take a `protocols-path` input if your protocols live somewhere other than `protocols/`.
Neither hardcodes a repository name: `protocol_url` values are built from the repository the workflow
runs in, so nothing in the template needs editing to point at you.

`@v1` is a moving tag, so your repository tracks the standard without a pull request per release —
which is the point, since a validator that has fallen behind means silently enforcing an older
standard than you claim to follow. To hold a fixed version instead, pin the release tag `@v1.0.0`
and update it by hand — or, since a git tag can itself be retargeted, pin a commit SHA, which is the
only genuinely immutable reference. Note that `generate-index` runs with `contents: write`.

Finally, open a pull request adding your repository to [`registry.yaml`](registry.yaml) so that
agents discover it.

## Development

*   `Rscript tests/run-tests.R` runs the whole suite. With no protocols in this repository, it is
    the tooling's only coverage:
    *   the validator against the conforming and deliberately malformed fixtures in
        `tests/fixtures/`, and against the starter protocol in `template/`. Each invalid fixture
        asserts the specific error it is supposed to provoke, so adding a rule to the standard means
        adding a fixture.
    *   `tests/test-repo-utils.R` — the repository and ref detection helpers, across the remote URL
        forms git actually produces. A local path must yield `NA` rather than a plausible but
        invented slug, since every `protocol_url` in a generated index is built from that answer.
    *   `tests/test-generator.R` — that the index names the detected repository and ref, copies
        frontmatter through whole, and **refuses to write at all** when it finds no protocols or
        cannot determine the repository. The index-generation action commits its output, so a wrong
        or empty index would be published without anyone looking at it.
*   `Rscript scripts/validate-protocol.R <dir>` runs the validator against a protocols directory
    directly — point it at a checkout of a content repository to reproduce a CI failure locally.
